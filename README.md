# TimeSignatR
TimeSignature R package v1.0

This package is currently under development to make it user-friendly.  In the interim, the script R/TimeStampFns.R contains all the necessary functions for carrying out a TimeSignature analysis, and the example/ subdirectory contains example code to train and apply TimeSignature and reproduce Fig 1 from the paper.  The user is encouraged to read all scripts prior to use.

Going forward, the R/TimeStampFns.R script will be turned into a fully-documented package that can be installed using the usual R tools.
