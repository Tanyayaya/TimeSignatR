# TimeStampR
TimeStamp R package

This package is currently under development to make it user-friendly.  In the interim, the script R/TimeStampFns.R contains all the necessary functions for carrying out a TimeStamp analysis.  The user is encouraged to read this script prior to using it.

Going forward, the R/TimeStampFns.R script will be turned into a fully-documented package that can be installed using the usual R tools.
